For example, consider the strings "abcde" and "ace". The LCS of these two strings is "ace", which is a sequence of characters that appears in both strings:

"a" appears at index 0 in both strings.
"c" appears at index 2 in both strings.
"e" appears at index 4 in both strings.
The LCS "ace" has a length of 3, which means it contains 3 characters.

function largestCommonSubSequence(str1,str2,i,j){
	if(i==str1.length || j==str2.length)
		return 0;
	let ans = 0;
    if(str1[i] == str2[j]){
		ans = 1 + largestCommonSubSequence(str1, str2, i+1, j+1);
	}
    else{
		let op1 = largestCommonSubSequence(str1,str2, i+1, j);
		let op2 = largestCommonSubSequence(str1,str2, i, j+1);
		ans = Math.max(op1,op2);
	}
    return ans;
}
console.log(largestCommonSubSequence("abcde","ace",0,0)); //ace
